# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component solution

This is a challenge from Frontend Mentor for improving your skillset and complete a requested layout.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My first experience with tailwind, took longer time because you had to search for every command but when you started to get a feel for it, it was a great experience. I got to use both responsive utilites, hover and transform.

I also learned setting up my own tailwind config with custom made colors, width sizes and fonts.
